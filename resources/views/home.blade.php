        <p>Welcome to our information website made for the Kyoto University by Tempus Indicium. In this web interface you can view weather information made available to the Kyoto University. </p>
        <p>You can request weather information from different stations over Japan. At the top of the page there are several buttons going to different parts of the website, such as the map. On the map you can click on the stations and get specific information about that station. The top 10 button goes to a page showing a table of the top 10 stations over Asia based on visibility. For help and support, there is a help page. </p>
        <p>We also offer an api to access our data directory to Kyoto University. On the help page you can find more information about the api.</p>
